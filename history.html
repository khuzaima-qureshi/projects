    <h1>TAJ MAHAL</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="tajborder">The Taj Mahal is an iconic monument located in Agra, India. It is widely considered one of
    the most beautiful and famous buildings in the world and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The history behind the
    Taj Mahal is a story of love, architecture, and cultural significance.<br>

    The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. Mumtaz
    Mahal, whose real name was Arjumand Banu Begum, was the chief wife of Shah Jahan and had a profound influence on
    him. She died during the birth of their 14th child in 1631.<br>
    Deeply grief-stricken by her death, Shah Jahan decided to build a mausoleum in her memory that would be a
    testament to their love. Construction began in 1632, and the main mausoleum was completed in 1648, although the
    entire complex took several more years to finish. The site chosen for the construction was on the banks of the
    Yamuna River in Agra.<br>
    <b>The history behind the Taj Mahal is a poignant reminder of the power of love and the incredible achievements
      that can arise from it, even in the face of immense grief and loss.</b>

    <h1>MINAR-E-PAKISTAN</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="minarbordercontent">
    Minar-e-Pakistan, a prominent historical monument located in Iqbal Park, Lahore, holds great significance in the
    history of Pakistan. It was here, on March 23, 1940, that the All-India Muslim League convened a significant
    session, known as the Lahore Resolution, which laid the foundation for the creation of a separate Muslim state.
    The resolution marked a pivotal moment in the struggle for independence from British colonial rule and the demand
    for a separate homeland for Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. The design of Minar-e-Pakistan is a blend of
    Islamic and modern architectural styles, symbolizing the nation's unity and progress. Construction began in 1960,
    and the monument was completed in 1968. The towering minaret stands at a height of 70 meters and is surrounded by
    a large public space that serves as a gathering point for various national celebrations and events.
    Minar-e-Pakistan stands as an enduring testament to the determination and aspirations of the people of Pakistan,
    reminding them of their journey towards freedom and sovereignty.

    <h1>MOHENJO-DARO</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="mohenjodarobordercontent">

    Mohenjo-daro, which means "Mound of the Dead" in Sindhi, was once a bustling city with remarkably sophisticated
    urban planning and advanced engineering. Its layout featured a grid-like pattern of streets, an elaborate drainage
    system, and well-constructed brick buildings. The city's prosperity was likely fueled by trade, agriculture, and its
    strategic location along major trade routes.<br>

    Archaeological findings suggest that the people of Mohenjo-daro had a high level of social organization, with
    evidence of a class hierarchy and well-structured neighborhoods. The city also displayed a complex system of symbols
    and script, known as the Indus script, which, despite many efforts, remains largely undeciphered, leaving much of
    the civilization's written history a mystery.<br>

    By around 1900 BCE, Mohenjo-daro and other cities of the Indus Valley Civilization faced a decline, marked by the
    abandonment of urban centers. The exact reasons for this decline are still debated among historians and
    archaeologists, but factors such as environmental changes, shifts in trade routes, and socio-political changes
    likely played a role.<br>

    Today, Mohenjo-daro is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an important archaeological treasure that offers insights
    into the ancient past of South Asia. Excavations and research at the site continue to shed light on the daily life,
    culture, and technological advancements of the people who once inhabited this remarkable city.

    <h1>INDIA GATE</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="indiagatebordercontent">
    The India Gate, an iconic monument located in the heart of New Delhi, India, stands as a solemn tribute to the
    sacrifices made by Indian soldiers during various conflicts, most notably in World War I. The monument's history
    dates back to the early 20th century when it was originally conceived as the "All India War Memorial" to honor the
    soldiers of the British Indian Army who had lost their lives during World War I (1914-1918).<br>

    Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, a prominent British architect, the India Gate was inaugurated in 1931. It is a
    magnificent archway built from sandstone, rising to a height of 42 meters. The arch itself bears the names of over
    13,000 soldiers who died in various battles during the war.<br>

    The India Gate not only commemorates the sacrifices of Indian soldiers during World War I but also stands as a
    symbol of national pride and unity. Over the years, it has become a focal point for various ceremonial events,
    especially during Republic Day celebrations when the monument serves as a backdrop for the impressive parade down<br>
    Rajpath.

    Beyond its historical significance, the India Gate has become a cherished gathering place for people from all walks
    of life. Families, tourists, and locals alike visit the monument to pay their respects, relax in its sprawling
    lawns, and appreciate its architectural grandeur. As an enduring symbol of India's valor and the sacrifices of its
    soldiers, the India Gate continues to hold a special place in the hearts of Indians, reminding them of their rich
    history and the sacrifices made for the nation's freedom and prosperity.
